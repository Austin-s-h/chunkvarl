## Getting Started

This project is managed using uv. To create a ready-to-run virtual environment containing all dependencies for simulation run

```bash
uv venv
```

## Running your own simulations

TODO: Update `calc_dry.py` to operate on a simple data frame or even better, some sort of wiki lookup.

## Developer Setup

For documenting and testing purposes, or for local development

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```
